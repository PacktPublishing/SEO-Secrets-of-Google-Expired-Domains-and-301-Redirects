## About the Video Course
Did you know that Buying EXPIRED DOMAINS and then redirecting them using a 301 Redirect will transfer 100% of THEIR SEO to YOUR SITE?!?! It's true. Here's the catch... certain metrics need to align with your site, keywords & optimizations if you are going to reap the FULL BENEFITS of buying expired domains. Even cooler, I'm going to teach you how to get THE SAME SEO... but WITHOUT BUYING A DOMAIN! Yeah, there are a lot of cool secrets inside this course. In fact, I know about 25% of my students will DOUBLE THEIR SEO from just 1 small change in their .htaccess file. And if you don't know what that is... then, this course is for you! Get even better SEO, better rankings, and without having to do any real "legwork" of (take your pick): creating high-quality & original content, videos, image editing, link building, time (aka patience), and so much more. You can SKIP ALL THIS with the use of 301 Redirects and the use of expired domains (whether you want to spend money buying them OR NOT) you can still get valuable links & link juice from them with this secret I'll teach inside.
